# About the project

Game Hub lists all the latest games and allows you to **filter** and sort based on Platform, Genres, and Order.

The game list (main page) has an **infinite scroll**, so you can scroll through until all games are fetched.

Also, you can **search** for the game of your choice through the search bar.

By selecting any game, you can see further **detailed info about the game**, including the trailer (if available) and photos of the game.

There is a white and dark **theme** available for this site as well.

_Note: This is only front-end project; game resources are fetched using the open-source RAWG API_
